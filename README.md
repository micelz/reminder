# Reminder

This simple reminder app arised while I've been playing around with electron and angular. The app might be helpful for
someone who works on projects where update scripts needs to be executed to keep a clean and functional environment. To 
remind you what script have already been updated, an underlying database will save any approved and executed scripts. 

## Installation

To get started, clone the repo to your target directory. This app uses Webpack, and a few commands 
have been provided as scripts in `package.json`.

```bash
npm install

# To build only
npm run build

# Start the Electron app
npm run electron
```
